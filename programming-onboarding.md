### Kotlin resources

This year on prog, we're going to be making the switch from Java to Kotlin. If you're already proficient in Java, Python, or any similar language, the best place to learn is from the [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html) or Tutorialspoint.

If you're a beginner, most Kotlin tutorials you'll find online are either designed for people who already know Java, or are looking to do Android development. The best resource for someone in your situation is [Head First Kotlin](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Kotlin-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1491996692).

Before you start the rest of your prog training, you'll need to be reasonably good at Kotlin. To make sure everyone is on the same page during programming discussions, write a program that meets the following requirements:

- Process Strings from console input
- Hold an inventory of `Item` objects, that the user can manipulate and view
- Item is an abstract classs, and each type of Item should extend it
- Must use a Kotlin "when" statment (similar to a switch statement)
- Must have an inline class definition (that you use somewhere)
- Must use a for-each loop
- Must use a Ternary operator
- Must appropriately use `val` and `var`
- Must use a `filter` statment
- Must follow the [Kotlin Style Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)

### Git(hub) requirements

For collaboration, we use Github to share code. When you first start learning Git and Github, it's important to know the difference between them:
- **Git** is a free and open source version control system that allows you to work in teams and keep track of your code history.
- **GitHub** is a cloud service owned by Microsoft that lets you manage your Git repositories for free. There are other online services similar to Github, but Github is the most popular.

I made a slide deck that explains most of the Git features you'll need to know for robotics at a high level, which you can view [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MNZY5AGBjoUL_nHSWLreXEC06QkSJMxzhAiljMVCe2g/edit?usp=sharing). 

After you understand general git concepts, install GitHub Desktop and read some of the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

Then, to verify that you've learned enough Git:
- Clone the Sushi Squad onboarding repository from https://github.com/SushiSquad7461/Kotlin-onboarding 
- Put your Kotlin project into the repo, and give it a cool name
- Add, commit, and push your changes to a new branch
- Make a pull request so I can look over your project and verify that it meets the requirements.
