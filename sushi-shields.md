Our team has been fortunate enough to have the resources necessary in order to sustain through these unprecedented times, and we are ready to give back to those who have kept us healthy. We wish to support medical personnel and essential workers in fighting COVID in any way we can. 

Currently, we are trying to mobilize and inspire the community to use affordable, accessible materials to create homemade PPE face shields, which we call Sushi Shields, through providing incentives and achievable goals for those who do. These face shields are constructed using inexpensive PETG Polycarbonate sheets and are designed to be both protective against large droplets and easily sanitizable.
